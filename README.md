**Instructor**: Isha Dewan | **Team**: Saransh Gupta, Rohan P. Shinde   
**Objective**: Develop and test non-parametric methods for detecting scale parameter differences.  

### **Methodology**  
- **Test Development**:  
  - Modified Median, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum (WRS), and Mann-Whitney tests.  
  - Analyzed Capon, Klotz, and Mood test statistics.  
- **Simulation Efficiency**:  
  - Reduced data generation time by **4x** using parallel processing in R (`foreach` package).  

### **Key Contributions**  
  - Derived test statistics for specific distributions.
  - Developed new non-parametric tests to assess the significance of the scale parameter, improving existing tests for location parameters.

## **3. Regression Analysis for Health Insurance Premium Prediction**  
[![R](https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-276DC3?logo=R)](https://www.r-project.org/) [![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=Python)](https://www.python.org/)  

**Instructor**: Deepayan Sarkar   
**Objective**: Predict health insurance premium costs using regression techniques and compare model performance.  

### **Methodology**  
- **Multiple Linear Regression**:  
  - Applied Box-Cox transformation to address non-normality in skewed variables.  
  - Diagnosed collinearity using Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) and Added-Variable Plots.  
  - Validated linearity assumptions with Residual and Component Plots.  
  - Detected outliers via Cookâ€™s Distance, Hat-values, and Boxplots.  
- **Robust Regression**:  
  - Fitted models using Huber, Bi-Square, and Least Absolute Deviation loss functions.  
  - Implemented resistant regression (LTS, LMS) to handle outliers.  
- **Model Selection**:  
  - Used BIC for forward/backward selection to identify the best-performing model.  

### **Key Contributions**  
- Compared parametric and non-parametric models using MAD and MSE.  
- Reduced prediction errors by **34%** using robust regression techniques.
